# Student Course Enrollment System

This project was developed as a part of a genspark-assigned technical task. It showcases a complete backend system (with optional frontend) to manage student-course enrollments. The system demonstrates proficiency in building enterprise-grade REST APIs using **Spring Boot**, along with modern authentication, relational data modeling, and deployment best practices.

* Manage students and courses (CRUD operations)
* View and filter enrollments
* Secure role-based access

### üë®‚Äçüéì Student Functionality

* View available courses
* Enroll in multiple courses
* Check own enrollments

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Backend  | Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate |
| Database | PostgreSQL (hosted on Railway/Render)   |
| Frontend | (Optional) React, Axios                 |
| Security | Spring Security, JWT Authentication     |

* Many-to-Many between Students and Courses
* `Enrollment` acts as the join table with `enrollmentDate`
